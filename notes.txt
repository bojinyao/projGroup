1. think of hard example without rowdy group 
    - more connected graph
    - each bus can hold less than average degree of number of students
    - k = #buses = roundup(student / s)
2. then think of hard problems with the rowdy group 


Coloring - buses: number of colors 
rowdy groups: sub graphs where at least one node with a different color

Some reductions:
1. Approximate Max 2 SAT
2. Coloring
3. Maximally connected sub-graphs


Good idea:
1. use connected components to "reduce" the graph to a smaller graph as H   
2. Color H 
3. recover components using the colored H
4. satisfy S
